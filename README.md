# Step 1
I reviewed the class recordings while taking notes and reviewing.

# 2nd step
I researched with GPT chat (https://chat.openai.com/c/5e16fe3c-16e3-43fc-ada7-499b18e26241) and Blackbox (https://www.blackbox.ai/) to come up with the formulas that helped me to fit it into my code according to what I needed.

# 3rd step
I went to AskBcs when the code gave me an error or did not reflect the expected result.

# 4th step
I got help from a friend who studied data analysis, he guided me and pushed me to continue and finish the exercise.
